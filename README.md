The video is prepared as part of the submission to the [International Conference on Process Mining ICPM 2023](https://icpmconference.org/2023/).

Due to time constraints, very few questions have been shown. Feel free to try the application with questions such as:
* Compute the automation rate
* Who are the most overloaded
* Find the most executed activities
* and others

## :whale: Docker setup

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application using Docker:

1. **Download the code**:  
   Clone the project or download the code and unzip the downloaded folder.

2. **Set Up environment variables**:  
   - Open the file named `.env-example`.
   - Replace the placeholder `your-openai-key` with your actual OpenAI API key.
   - Save and close the file.
   - Rename the file to `.env`.

4. **Start Docker**:  
   Ensure that your Docker application is up and running.

5. **Execute Docker commands**:  
   - **For Windows users**:  
     Open the `cmd` as an administrator. Navigate to the project's root directory. Execute the following:
     ```
     run-proxchat-docker.bat
     ```
   - **For Linux users**:  
     In the terminal, from the project's root directory, execute:
     ```
     ./run-proxchat-docker.sh
     ```

   The `run-docker-commands` script will:
   - Start a MySQL service.
   - Populate the MySQL database with data from the `running-example.csv` file located in `/backend/src/data`.
   - load the docker images for both the frontend and backend applications.

6. **Verify container creation**:  
   After successful execution, Docker will have created images for the application. A container named `proxchat` will be up and running with an associated data volume to ensure data persistence.

7. **Access the application**:  
   You can access the running application via your web browser at:  
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## How to use the application

1. **Query execution data**:  
   Begin your queries on the execution data that corresponds to the BPMN process using natural language. Frame your questions, and the system will provide insights based on the data.

2. üö® **IMPORTANT information about the data**:
   The provided execution data includes the following:
   - Case identifiers.
   - Names of the executed activities within a case.
   - Start and completion time for each activity.
   - The actor responsible for executing the activity.

## Feedback
3. **Logging**: The application records your interactions to a file called `interaction_log.txt`, stored in the `logs` directory at the root. This file includes the LLM's reasoning for your question and the corresponding SQL queries.
